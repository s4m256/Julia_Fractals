# Julia Fractals

Interactive **Julia set** visualizer built with **JavaScript + HTML Canvas**.

Each pixel is mapped to a point in the complex plane and iterated to determine whether it escapes, producing the characteristic Julia fractal patterns. The complex parameter **c** is controlled by the mouse, allowing real-time exploration.
