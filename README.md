# Julia Fractals

Interactive **Julia set** visualizer built with **JavaScript + HTML Canvas**.

Each pixel represents a point in the complex plane and is iterated using:

\[
z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c
\]

The complex parameter **c** is controlled by the mouse, allowing real-time exploration of different Julia fractals.
